        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The Straw Hat Pirates are a small but powerful pirate crew that originated from East Blue but have various members from different areas. They are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to him by Red-Haired Shanks[Person who inspired him to become a pirate] and are first referred to as the Straw Hat Pirates by Smoker[a Marine captain of the Navy aka World Government] in Alabasta.</p>
        <p> I have used 5 characters to represent my 'SuperheroApp' to give you information about these characters that I love so much and have been a supporting fan of One Piece(popular manga series) since 2019.</p>
        <p> I hope you found these characters intriguing. Thank you for your time.</p>
